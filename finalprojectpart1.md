## Project Summary 
For my final proejct, I  would love to talk about the topic of the enviromental impacts of clothing textiles. Clothing as a commodity that we all consume and need is an important part of our daily life. However, clothes not only has its value as to be worn, 
but also impact the environment before and after we purchase them. With shorten fashion cylces, the life cycle of a piece of cloth has also been shortened. How does a piece of clothe. I will take Gap as an example, first demonstrate what kind of fabric they
use the most for making all their clothes, and then I will go through each fabric and look into it's enviromental impacts while compare and contrast different fabrics. My goal is to let my audience aware how clothing has such an big impact on enviroment, and
how our purchase behavior and mindful choice over the things we buy can make a difference.
