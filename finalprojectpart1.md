## Project Summary 

[Go back to the main page](/README.md)

For my final project, I  would love to talk about the topic of the environmental implications  of clothing textiles. Everday, we wear clothes, change outfits, and often time purchase clothes from time to time without giving much thought to the process behind its creation. Clothing as a commodity that we all consume and need is an important part of our daily life. While clothes provide us with a means of self-expression and protection, they also leave an environmental footprint that is often overshadowed by fashion trends and consumerism.

With this project, I will focus on the how a piece of clothing impact the enviroment in terms of its carbon emission, water usage and energy input. Through those aspects, the audeince should have a rough idea of how does each fabric impacts the enviroment differently. By shedding light on these aspects, I hope to bring forth a new perspective on clothing. The intention is not to instill guilt but to empower the audience with knowledge. Every clothing choice we make has an environmental consequence, and by being aware, we can make more informed and sustainable decisions. At the end of this presentation, I aspire for everyone to not just see a piece of fabric, but to recognize the story of the environment intertwined with it. The next time you stand before your wardrobe or walk into a store, you'll be armed with the knowledge to make eco-conscious choices.


### Introduction:  Gap clothing fabric breakdown 
- To start the story, I want to position my audience as potential customers who go to a clothing store to shop for clothes, and for this scenerio I will pick GAP as I have gap clothing fabric avaliable and it is a common well-known brand. At this part, I will demonstrate the percentage of different fabric that are used by the brand as those are also likely to be the fabric that a customer interact with the most. I hope to start the story with a light and easy tone as people often associate shopping with positive feelings as it can be related to  leisure time, investing in one's appearance and getting new things. By sharing the percentage chart, the audience will be aware of the topic of the presentation.

### Fabric environmental imapct 
For this part, I will first introduce the different aspects of enviromental impacts for the clothing fabric: 
- Carbon Footprint: This gauges the total greenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by a fabric throughout its lifecycle.
- Energy Consumption: This measures the amount of energy required to produce a fabric, from raw material extraction to the final product.
- Water Footprint: This evaluates the volume of freshwater used to produce the fabric, accounting for both the direct and indirect water use.
I then will demonstrate how different fabric rank differently in those aspects through a graph like the following.These charts will help distinguish between what might be
 termed an 'eco-friendly fabric' and a 'less sustainable fabric.'This visual representation will illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of each fabric, offering a nuanced understanding of their environmental implications when assessed through different lenses. At this point, I hope the presentation can encourage the audience to reflect and start to think about what thier clothes are made of and weather thier past clothing choices
have been done well from an enviromental perspective.

### Customer choice 
Lastly I want to bring the story together, for a customer, how can this help them to make smarter choice when they shop next time? In addition to the enviromental impact that has already been introduced 
I would also like to introduce the price aspect. As from an ordinary customer's perspective, the price of the clothing is often a key factor. Therefore, I would like to address the concern by looking at the
price difference of clothes made by different materials and hopefully give my audience hope that they can make environmentally conscious chocie over clothes will be friendly to their wallet. In addition, 
when adding the facts that clothes can last a while, what type of fabric to choose for what type of cloth that can not only be financially efficient but also enviromentally friendly will be the key take away 
for the audience. 

I want to end the presentation on a pleasant note where the audience feel more educated and inspired to make better choice next time.

  offer the freedome for audience to decide what is their best option enviromentally given their own budget for certain clothes.

### lastly call for action/ audience take away 
Hopefully by the end of this presentation, the audience are more aware of the overall environmental influence of fabirc over enviroment, being able to recall good fabric vs bad fabric and hopefully be more
mindful during their next clthoiing purchase. The goal is for customer the knowledge to make a smart decision. With everything else the same (price range, clothing type), what can be a better option for the enviroment. 

## Data Source 

GAP clothing fabric data: 
I collected this data through web scrapping its website and record each clothing item's name, price, category and fabric. By using this data set, we can take a deeper look of what everyday clothes are made of, how much does it cost and how different type of fabric make different type of clothes. By using a well-known brand, I hope it can feel reltable with the audience. The colothing fabric column will be used for part 1 to demonstrate the percentage that made up the brand's products.  Product Type, price and fabric column 
will be used for part three where the audience can learn more in depth about each category of clothing in comparison of its fabric enviromental score and price.

environmental impactï¼š 
I collected this data from a few different sources as listed in the sheet. This dataset will be used mainly for part 2 where I demonstrate the difference enviromental impacts for different fabric. Through this dataset, we can look deeper into how 
different fabric impact the enviroment differently.

## Method and Medium 
I will be use shorthand to present the story with data visaiuzliation and written paragraphs to commmunicate the story together.
