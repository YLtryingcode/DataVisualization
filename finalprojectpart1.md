## Project Summary 
For my final proejct, I  would love to talk about the topic of the enviromental impacts of clothing textiles. Clothing as a commodity that we all consume and need is an important part of our daily life. However, clothes not only has its value as to be worn, 
but also impact the environment before and after we purchase them. And such impacts are often over looked. 

How does a piece of clothing impact the enviroment in terms of its carbon emission, water usage and degrateable duration will be the focus of this project. Hopefully by the end of this presentation, the audience will be more aware of the enviromental impacts of different fabirc and be more mindful when they are making a clothing purchasing choice next time 


### Introduction:  Gap clothing fabric breakdown 
- To start the story, I want to position my audience as potential customers who go to a clothing store to shop for clothes, and for this scenerio I will pick GAP as I have gap clothing fabric avaliable. At this part, I will demonstrate the percentage of different fabric is being used by the brand as those are also likely to be the fabric that a clothing customer interact with the most.

For this part, I will first introduce a few of measurements to determine on what level will all the fabric be compared to. Then I will present the following bar chart that demonstrate the difference between a 'good fabric' and a 'bad fabric' from an enviromental perspective.

### Customer choice 
From an ordinary customer's perspective, the price of the clothing is often a key factor before the fabric. Therefore, I would like to address the concern by looking at the price difference of clothes made by different materials and hopefully give my audience hope that they can make enviromentally conscious chocie over clothes will be friendly to their wallet.

## Data Source 

GAP clothing fabric data: 
I collected this data through web scrapping its website and record each clothing item's name, price, category and fabric. By using this data set, we can take a deeper look of what everyday clothes are made of, how much does it cost and how different type of fabric make different type of clothes. By using a well-known brand, I hope it can feel reltable with the audience.
