# Final Project Part II
For this part, I would like to demonstrate a draft version of my final project and interviewing people to receive  thier feedbacks on the current sketch in order to improve. 

## Wireframes/Storyboards 
For my wireframe, I decided to build directly in shorthand with visualization from tableau. 

[shorthand storyboard](https://preview.shorthand.com/svyRkkoViol8z3Sp)


After careful consideration, I decide to narrow down the story and focusing on two most common fabris, Cotton and Polyster, instead of all the fabric that is avaliable in the given store. 
This way, it allows me to go deep into comparison through different angels while keeping the audience engaged. 
The design of the story will follow a basic story telling structure - setup, conflict and resolution 
For setup, I want to start introducing clothing shopping while proposing the questions about clothing fabric. 
For conflict, I draw a comparison between cotton and polyster and the pro and cons for each material. 
Lastly, the resolution will be offer guidance for audience to make better decision when purchase clothes. 


## User Research 
### Target Audience 
My target audience are 
- Eco-Consious & General Consumers: many consumers are willing to make more enviromental friendly decisions but do not know where to start or what kind of change they can and should make. This story will help them to better understanding the implication of thier clothing purchasing choices.
  For eco-consious consumers, this story will provide more detailed data for their decision making process.
  
- Students: Students who are interested in being eco-friendly can benefit from understanding the implication of fabric choices. This may shape thier future decision. 

- Retailers: Retailers decide what products to stock and promote. By understanding the pros and cons of cotton and polyester, they can make informed decisions on what to offer to consumers.

### Interview Findings 
( Male, late 30s, General Consumer) 

Goal 1 : clear for pros and cons of buying polyster and cotton. Unclear: Energy usage for production was unlcear. 'all I know was Polyster takes twice as much to produce but I have no idea what the number means. Same with water consume. It will be nice to have a reference point to understand the number. In the first pie chart, other materials draw attention away, if you can group by the rest of the material together, it will be more clear rather than list all of them randomly. 

Goal 2: Yes I do think it is relavant. As a consious consumer, it is nice to know that whichever choice we make there is impact to the enviroment. I am suprise that polyester takes 200 years to decompose. I never really thought about it. 

Goal 3 : No, it was a nice pace and I like the flow. Yes, the first pie chart was a little confusing and distracting. The price differnce of those two white t-shirt does not make a huge difference for me. And I prefer 100% cotton when it comes to comfort. 

Goal 4: It would be nice to have more slide to explain the energy & water consumption.  Also how has cotton impact biodiversity excatly? 

(Female, mid 20s, student) 
Goal 1: I am a little confused about your conclusion. I wonder what is your opinion of those two fabric, like do you suggest one is better than the other for consumer? 

Goal 2: Yes, since I do purchase clothes very often. This provides a new aspect to consider when I buy new clotehs. 

Goal 3: I like the flow of the story. If you can fit the bubble chart in one slide, that will be eaiser to read since now it feels overwhelming. 

Goal 4: I would like more depth into the enviromental impacts and why should general public care about it. 

(Male, late 20s, student) 
Goal 1: The first pie chart that shows different purchasing frequency was confusing since you used the same color for less frequent buyers but different shade of green for the more frequent buyers. 
Also you do not really need the first pie chart for different fabric since the bubble chart has already done that. 

Goal 2: Yes, I was suprised by how often people purchase clothes since I personally buy clothes less than once a year. 

Goal 3: I wish you can add more slides and information about the enviromental impacts and what those number mean and what are the consequences or opportunity cost of producing the fabric. 

Goal 4: I think  you can add statement at the 'Call for Action' session, such as tell the audience to be more mindful for thier clothing choice and add more website to find enviromentally friendly stores, information about other fabrics 

## Identified changes for Part III 
- improve the pie chart
