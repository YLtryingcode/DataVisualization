# Final Project Part II
For this part, I would like to demonstrate a draft version of my final project and interviewing people to receive  thier feedbacks on the current sketch in order to improve. 

## Wireframes/Storyboards 
For my wireframe, I decided to build directly in shorthand with visualization from tableau. 

[shorthand storyboard](https://preview.shorthand.com/svyRkkoViol8z3Sp)


After careful consideration, I decide to narrow down the story and focusing on two most common fabris, Cotton and Polyster, instead of all the fabric that is avaliable in the given store. 
This way, it allows me to go deep into comparison through different angels while keeping the audience engaged. 
The design of the story will follow a basic story telling structure - setup, conflict and resolution 
For setup, I want to start introducing clothing shopping while proposing the questions about clothing fabric. 
For conflict, I draw a comparison between cotton and polyster and the pro and cons for each material. 
Lastly, the resolution will be offer guidance for audience to make better decision when purchase clothes. 


## User Research 
### Target Audience 
My target audience are 
- Eco-Consious & General Consumers: many consumers are willing to make more enviromental friendly decisions but do not know where to start or what kind of change they can and should make. This story will help them to better understanding the implication of thier clothing purchasing choices.
  For eco-consious consumers, this story will provide more detailed data for their decision making process.
  
- Students: Students who are interested in being eco-friendly can benefit from understanding the implication of fabric choices. This may shape thier future decision. 

- Retailers: Retailers decide what products to stock and promote. By understanding the pros and cons of cotton and polyester, they can make informed decisions on what to offer to consumers.
