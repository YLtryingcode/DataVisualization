## Overview 
Hello there, welcome to my page! This is my public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data class ( aka. Data Visualization ) at CMU. I will use this place to demonstrate my learning process during this course and continue to post more data visualization along my journey as a data analyst. 

## About Me 
Hello! I'm Yilin Lyu (pronouns: She/Her). I'm in my second year at Heinz College, pursuing a degree in Public Policy and Management with a specialization in Data Analytics. I've always been captivated by the power of data science; it's remarkable how it can uncover profound insights from the vast sea of data that surrounds us. My aspiration post-graduation is to harness the potential of data science to drive business growth and innovation.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking and photography. 

## What I hope to learn 
I aspire to master the art of crafting data visualizations that are not only aesthetically appealing but also comprehensible. My ultimate goal is to design visuals that bridge communication gaps, ensuring that diverse audiences can easily grasp and engage with the information presented.
