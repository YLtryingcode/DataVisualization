For this visualization, I've honed in on the top three countries with the highest debt, tracking its progression over the years. Initially, I began with a comprehensive dataset. However, juxtaposing the data of all countries year-by-year made the visualization cluttered and challenging for viewers to decipher. Consequently, I streamlined the number of countries and years showcased.




### Upon comparing the three visualizations, each has its unique strengths and limitations:

- Bar Chart: This offers an effective year-by-year comparison of a country's debt. By highlighting specific countries, it becomes easier for viewers to focus on particular nations of interest.
- Grid of Line Chart: This provides a detailed view of each country's debt trajectory over time. It's ideal for those keen on a specific country and those seek to compare a few selected nations.
- Bar Comparison Graph: This narrows down to just the top three debt-laden countries. It's especially valuable for audiences intrigued by these nations and their evolving debt scenarios.

By tailoring the visualization approach, we can cater to diverse audience needs and preferences.
