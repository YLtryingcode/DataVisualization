## Project Summary 

For my final project, I am eager to discuss the environmental implications of clothing textiles. Every day, we wear clothes, switch outfits, and often purchase new garments without deeply considering the processes behind their creation. Clothing, an essential commodity for all of us, serves not only as a medium of self-expression and protection but also leaves an environmental footprint that's frequently overshadowed by fashion trends and consumerism.

This project will delve into how clothing impacts the environment, focusing on carbon emissions, water consumption, and energy input. Through this analysis, the audience will gain insights into the varying environmental consequences of different fabrics. My aim is not to induce guilt but to empower viewers with knowledge. Every clothing decision we make carries an environmental implication. With increased awareness, we can make choices that are both informed and sustainable. By the end of this presentation, I hope attendees will view fabrics not just as materials but as entities intertwined with environmental narratives. The next time you browse your wardrobe or shop, you'll have the insights to make eco-conscious decisions.



### Part 1: Introduction:  Gap clothing fabric breakdown 
I'll begin the narrative by positioning the audience as potential shoppers at a clothing store. I chose GAP as the store to feature due to the availability of its fabric data and its widespread brand recognition. Here, I'll showcase the distribution of fabrics employed by the brand, representing the materials most customers frequently encounter. By presenting this data, I hope to set a relatable and positive tone, associating the act of shopping with leisure, self-investment, and the joy of acquiring new items. The fabric distribution chart will firmly establish the presentation's theme for the audience.

###  Part 2: Fabric environmental imapct 
In this section, I'll introduce the various environmental metrics associated with clothing fabrics:

- Carbon Footprint: Represents the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions generated directly and indirectly by a fabric across its lifespan.
- Energy Consumption: Denotes the energy needed to transform raw materials into the final fabric.
- Water Footprint: Quantifies the total freshwater utilized in fabric production, incorporating both direct and indirect consumption.
- 
Subsequently, I'll illustrate how fabrics differ in these metrics. The charts will differentiate 'eco-friendly' fabrics from their less sustainable counterparts. These visuals will highlight the strengths and pitfalls of each fabric type, providing a comprehensive understanding of their environmental ramifications. I hope this part of the presentation prompts attendees to introspect about their clothing choices from an environmental viewpoint.

### Part 3: Customer choice 
How can the insights shared assist customers in making judicious shopping decisions? Beyond the environmental dimensions already explored, I'll introduce the financial facet. Since price often dominates consumer decisions, I'll compare the costs associated with various fabric types, assuring the audience that eco-friendly choices can also be economically viable. Factoring in the durability of clothing, I'll discuss how fabric selection for specific garments can optimize both financial and environmental outcomes.
I want to end the presentation on a pleasant note where the audience feels more educated and inspired to make better choices next time.

Combining with the enviromental impact information before, this offers the freedom for audience to decide what is their best option enviromentally given their own budget for certain clothes.

### call for action
By the presentation's close, I aspire for the audience to be more cognizant of the broader environmental influences of fabrics. Ideally, they'll be able to discern between sustainable and fewer sustainable materials and apply this knowledge during their subsequent shopping experiences. The overarching goal is to equip consumers with the knowledge to make discerning decisions.
- Rule of thumb
    - natural fabric is always better than synthetic fabric
    - If possible, try to extend the duration of a clothin's life time. Buy fewer item with good quality and wear them for longer 

## Data Source 

GAP clothing fabric data: 
I acquired this data by web scraping the GAP website, capturing details about each product's name, price, category, and fabric composition. Using this dataset, we can scrutinize the composition of everyday attire, its price points, and the fabrics employed. By leveraging a renowned brand, I anticipate establishing relatability with the audience. The dataset's 'clothing fabric' column will aid the first part of the presentation, demonstrating the fabric distribution across the brand's offerings. The 'Product Type', 'price', and 'fabric' columns will be instrumental for the third part, facilitating a deeper exploration of garment categories vis-à-vis their fabric's environmental score and price.

environmental impact： 
This data was collated from various sources as I could not find a publicly avaliable data source that had published all the following data. I went to a few sources to collect the data point presented in the spreadsheet. It will predominantly serve the second part of the presentation, illustrating the differential environmental footprints of various fabrics for part 2. I hope to draw conclusion  and also deliver the message of how fabric have different impacts on the enviroment.

## Method and Medium 
I will be using shorthand to present the story with data visualization  and written paragraphs to communicate the story together.
