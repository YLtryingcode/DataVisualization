# Final Project Part III 

## The final data story

## Change made since Part II 
- stage setup. For the final design, I decided to put the two graph ("People has been increasing their clothing purchase every year excpet during the COVID year" & "How often do Americans Buy Clothes?") together.I want to use the visuals, along with detailed text descriptions to set the stage for the narrative, highlighting the increasing frequency and volume of clothing purchases.
- I removed the initial pie chart detailing all the fabric distribution, left only with the one focusing on cotton and polyester. As my emphasis will be primarily on these two materials, it's more reasonable to center the audience's attention on them.
- Switched the data visualization format for fabric usage from bubble chart to tree chart.The tree chart aligns better with the website's aesthetics, is less overwhelming in terms of color and form, and offers a more straightforward interpretation for viewers.
- Added infographic to explain the enviromental impact difference between cotton and polyester. In response to feedback from Part II, I recognized that some data points, like the '125 MJ energy cost', could be vague. Therefore,  I decided to add  more reference point for the data, such as it takes 'Polyester needs 125 MJ of energy to produce for 1 kg, which is approximately the amount of electricity usage for an average U.S. household  per day'. This way, the data point will be easier to interpret for general audience. In addition, I decided to put the data point for each aspect of cotton and polyester next to each other so it will be easy for the audience to to facilitate direct comparison.

## The audience 
My primary audience comprises general consumers, particularly those who frequently buy clothes. Through this presentation, I aspire to turn their attention to the fabrics used in their clothing purchases. The objective isn't to promote one material over the otherâ€”both cotton and polyester have their  advantages and disadvantages in production. Instead, the aim is to spur consumers into making environmentally-conscious choices. Every purchase is an voting process for supporting one iterm over the other, urging more production of that item or its kind. If consumers become even slightly more environmentally aware, we can collectively mitigate the fashion industry's environmental impact.

## Final thoughts 
It was actually harder than I thought to tell a cohesive story with data since it's more than a presentation. Rather than just create data visualiation, this project  encouraged me to think how different information and data are connected together and how to best present them to ensure clarity and engagement for the audience.
