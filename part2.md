# Final Project Part II

For this part, I would like to demonstrate a draft version of my final project and interview people to receive their feedback on the current sketch in order to improve it. 

## Wireframes/Storyboards 
For my wireframe, I decided to build directly in shorthand with visualization from the tableau. 


[shorthand storyboard](https://preview.shorthand.com/svyRkkoViol8z3Sp)


After careful consideration, I decided to narrow down the story and focus on the two most common fabrics, Cotton and polyester, instead of all the fabric that is available in the given store. 
This way, it allows me to go deep into comparison through different angles while keeping the audience engaged. 
The design of the story will follow a basic storytelling structure - setup, conflict, and resolution 
For setup, I want to start introducing clothing shopping while asking questions about clothing fabric. 
For conflict, I draw a comparison between cotton and polyester and the pros and cons of each material. 
Lastly, the resolution will offer guidance for the audience to make better decisions when purchasing clothes. 


## User Research 
### Target Audience 
My target audience is 
- Eco-Consious & General Consumers: many consumers are willing to make more environmentally friendly decisions but do not know where to start or what kind of changes they can and should make. This story will help them to better understand the implications of their clothing purchasing choices.
  For eco-conscious consumers, this story will provide more detailed data for their decision-making process.
  
- Students: Students who are interested in being eco-friendly can benefit from understanding the implications of fabric choices. This may shape their future decision. 

- Retailers: Retailers decide what products to stock and promote. By understanding the pros and cons of cotton and polyester, they can make informed decisions on what to offer to consumers.

- How do you feel about the balance between the environmental impact, durability, and price discussions? Was one more compelling or relevant to you than the others?"

### Interview Findings 
#### ( Male, late 30s, General Consumer) 

Goal 1: clear on pros and cons of buying polyester and cotton. Unclear: Energy usage for production was unclear. 'all I know is Polyester takes twice as long to produce but I have no idea what the number means. Same with water consumption. It would be nice to have a reference point to understand the number. In the first pie chart, other materials draw attention away, if you can group the rest of the material together, it will be clearer than listing all of them randomly. 

Goal 2: Yes I do think it is relevant. As a conscious consumer, it is nice to know that whichever choice we make there is an impact on the environment. I am surprised that polyester takes 200 years to decompose. I never really thought about it. 

Goal 3: No, it was a nice pace and I like the flow. Yes, the first pie chart was a little confusing and distracting. The price difference between those two white T-shirts does not make a huge difference to me. And I prefer 100% cotton when it comes to comfort. 

Goal 4: It would be nice to have more slides to explain the energy & water consumption.  Also, how has cotton impacted biodiversity exactly? 

#### (Female, mid 20s, student) 
Goal 1: I am a little confused about your conclusion. I wonder what your opinion is of those two fabrics, like do you suggest one is better than the other for consumers? 

Goal 2: Yes, since I do purchase clothes very often. This provides a new aspect to consider when buying new clothes. 

Goal 3: I like the flow of the story. If you can fit the bubble chart in one slide, that will be easier to read since it now  feels overwhelming. 

Goal 4: I would like more depth into the environmental impacts and why the general public should care about them. 

#### (Male, late 20s, student) 

Goal 1: The first pie chart that shows different purchasing frequencies was confusing since you used the same color for less frequent buyers but different shades of green for the more frequent buyers. 
Also, you do not really need the first pie chart for different fabrics since the bubble chart has already done that. 

Goal 2: Yes, I was surprised by how often people purchase clothes since I personally buy clothes less than once a year. 

Goal 3: I wish you could add more slides and information about the environmental impacts what those numbers mean and what are the consequences or opportunity cost of producing the fabric. 

Goal 4: I think  you can add a statement at the 'Call for Action session, such as telling the audience to be more mindful of their clothing choices and add more websites to find environmentally friendly stores, information about other fabrics 

## Identified changes for Part III 
### Data Viusalization Change 
  - change the color for purchasing frequency pie chart
  - delete the first fabric makeup chart
  - resize the bubble chart to make it fit the slide better
### Content change 
  - add more details for the environmental impact part of each fabric by adding a reference point to help the audience understand
  - finish the ending call for action section
### Finish the citation for data sources
